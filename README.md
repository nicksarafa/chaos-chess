# Chaos Chess

Chaos chess is chess but created in the most chaotic way possible.

This vibe coded masterpiece is made to bring a new flair to the chess world.

In this game, new rules are introduced in the form of playing cards which can be played by each player bringing a new flair to the game

The goal of this project is to make chess fun again, and push the limits of chaos in the ancient art of Chess

Any ideas? Please open as issues.

Much love.
